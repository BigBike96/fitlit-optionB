# Refactor Tractor

In this project, the four of us were assigned to refactoring an existing code base.
The original project was called "Fitlit" and a student at Turing made it many years ago.
The existing codebase included tests suites, classes, sass files, an index file, fetch calls, and the main javaScript file.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Sass

**Testing** Chai & Mocha

**Lint:** ESlint & Prettier

**Server:** Node, Fetch API

## Features

- Able to randomly view somebody's hydration, activity, and sleep statistics
- Complete overhaul on the CSS
- Animations, transitions, and hover state have been included
- Script is dynamic and uses only data from fetch API calls
- Mobile and desktop friendly
- ARIA friendly
